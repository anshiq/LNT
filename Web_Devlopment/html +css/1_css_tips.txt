font-size = rem 
padding margin em
widths =  percentage.

flexbox
justify-content: space-between, centre, space-around, space-evenly  ; space-between automatically evenly distribute remaining space in boxes. space-around automatically evenly distribute remaining space in boxes and left right also.
align-items: centre, flex-start, flex-end // to set vertical position of items.
on changing flex-direction: column or row // the properties of align items and justify content gets exchanged.
